A palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward, eg "anna".

I want you to create a new Console Application called Palindromes.
Then create a new class called Palindrome, this class should have a public static method accepting a single parameter of type string and returning a bool.

The string needs to be tested to determine if it is a palindrome.
If it is a palindrome the method should return true, otherwise it should return false.

Look up some palindromes online and use these to test your program.
